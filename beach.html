<h1>BEACH!!!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of <a href="#nowhere">loose particles</a>. The
        particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or
        biological sources, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different densities and
        structures,depending on the local wave action and weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or
        layers of <span class="tag">material</span>

    <h2>Location and profile</h2>
    <p>There are several conspicuous parts to a beach that relate to the processes that form and shape it. The part
        mostly above water (depending upon tide), and more or less actively influenced by the waves at some point in the
        tide, is termed the beach berm. The berm is the deposit of material comprising the active shoreline. The berm
        has a crest (top) and a faceâ€”the latter being the slope leading down towards the water from the crest. At the
        very bottom of the face, there may be a trough, and further seaward one or more long shore bars: slightly
        raised, underwater embankments formed where the waves first start to break.
